# Simple PyQt Input Application

## Overview
This Python script creates a straightforward GUI application using the PyQt5 framework. Named `SimpleApp`, it features a clean and user-friendly interface for users to input three distinct values: the number of bots, routers, and nodes.

## Functionality
The application presents a window with a minimalistic design, hosting three vertically aligned input fields. Each field is designed to capture numeric input and is labeled with placeholder text to indicate its purpose. 

Below the input fields is a 'Submit' button. When clicked, this button activates a function that retrieves the data from the input fields and prints them to the console. This basic functionality demonstrates how to collect and process data from GUI elements.

## Extension and Customization
The script, in its current form, serves as a basic demonstration of data retrieval from GUI elements. However, it is modular and can be easily extended for more complex tasks like input validation, performing calculations, or integrating with databases or external APIs.

## Ideal for Learning
This application is an excellent starting point for beginners in GUI development with PyQt5. It illustrates fundamental concepts such as window creation, layout management, widget utilization, and event handling in a concise and understandable manner.
